"""FUNCTIONS"""

# 1. We'll say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values before and after it, and those values are
# different from it. Return a version of the given array where every instance of the given value which is alone is
# replaced by whichever value to its left or right is larger.

# 2. Write a function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30
# (both included).

# 3. Write a function which will take one argument n. Return a list of size n, that will contain random numbers
# from (-100, 400).

# 4. Write a function, that will take a list as an argument and return all the words in the list that start with a
# vowel.

poem = '''All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.'''
