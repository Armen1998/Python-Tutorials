"""SETUP"""

"""Links to Python, Anaconda, Pycharm"""

# 1. Python setup:
# For Windows:
# https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
# For macOS (if the latest version is not present already):
# https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
# For Linux based:
# https://www.python.org/downloads/source/ (you should download the source and compile it on your machine)

# Go ahead and download the latest stable version of Python (3.9.6 as of now).

# On macOS, the installation is pretty straightforward.

# On Windows, after opening the installer, make sure to check 'Add Python ... to PATH' to avoid any confusion in the
# future. Once the installation is finished, open up Command Prompt or Powershell and type 'python' and 'python -m pip'
# or just 'pip'. If you don't get a message like 'pip is not recognized as an internal or external command', then you're
# good to go!

# Note: pip is a Python package installer tool. You will use this in the future to install useful modules.

# Alternatively, you can download the Anaconda distribution of Python for all platforms from this website:
# https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
# Just choose the corresponding OS and download the installer or the source. The difference between the official Python
# distribution and Anaconda is that Anaconda comes with pre-installed Data Science related packages and has its own
# repos for modules. To install packages using Anaconda, you can use 'conda' command from the terminal.
# You can still use 'pip' to install packages.

# 2. Download the editor of your choice:
# My preferred editor is Pycharm, which will be used through this course. A link to that is the following:
# https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

# If you have IntelliJ IDEA already installed, you won't need a separate Pycharm program installed. In IntelliJ IDEA,
# press Ctrl+Alt+S, go to Plugins and search for Python. Install the plugin and enable it. Voila, you're good to go!

# Alternatively you can use VSCode or any other editor if you'd like.

# 3. Git:

# This video provides a detailed installation procedure for git on Windows:
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFwejIsHlY

# Git is usually pre-installed on macOS and on most Linux distributions.

"""Now the fun part!"""

# Go through the notes of our first lecture and open a Github account. Then:

# 1. Go to a folder of your choice and initiate a local git repository.
# 2. Configure git. Setup your username/email.
# 3. Check the status.
# 4. Create a file in your repo.
# 5. Check the status again.
# 6. Add the file to the staging area.
# 7. And again, check the status.
# 8. Commit changes with a meaningful message
# 9. Check, check and check the status.
# 10. Now do some changes to the file, then add and commit again

# Now, open up your Github account, create an online repository and connect it to your local one.
