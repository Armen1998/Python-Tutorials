# 1. Write a program to multiply all the items in a list.

# 2. Write a program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last
# character are same from a given list of strings.

# 3. Write a program that will remove duplicates from a list. DO NOT use set() method directly on the list.

# 4. Create a list from 5 user inputs.

# 5. Write a program to print the given list after removing the 2nd, 4th and 5th elements.

# 6. Given a list of ints, print True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere.

# 7. Given a list of ints, print True if every element is a 1 or a 4, and False otherwise.

# 8. Ask for user input and add that input as a key into the dictionary. Assign some arbitrary value to it.

# 9. Loop through the values of a dictionary and add them to a new list.

# 10. Write a script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included)
# and the values are square of keys.
