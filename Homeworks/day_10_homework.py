"""MODULES"""

# 1. Hangman!
# Create the hangman game. A list containing random words is provided. Each time the program runs, one random word must
# be selected. Then the user will try to guess the letters of the word. They will have lives equal to the length of the
# word. Now, about the formatting. Say we have the word car. The program must then output underscores equal to the
# length of the word.

# Guess a letter!
# _ _ _

# if we input 'a', the program will output:

# Guess a letter!
# _ a _

# and so on.

# 2. Write a function that will return the longest word in the random words file from the previous exercise.

# 3. Write a function that will take a string containing the path to a file as an argument and return its size in
# kilobytes.

# 4. Create a random number generator without using random module. The implementation is up to you. You may use
# current timestamp as a random seed.

# 5. Create a file and put your shopping list in it. The file must start with current day's date.
