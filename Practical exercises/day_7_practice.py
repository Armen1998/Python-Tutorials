"""RECURSION"""

# 1. Write the Fibonacci function using recursion.

# 2. Write a function to calculate the factorial of n recursively.

# 3. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of elements of a list.

# 4. Write a recursive function to calculate the geometric sum of n.

# 5. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of reciprocals of powers of 2. Try increasing the n and see the
# magic.

# 6. Write a recursive function to calculate n-th power of a.

# 7. Write a recursive function that evaluates a mathematical expression. Example input - "5 + 6"

# 8. Write a recursive function that reverses a string

# 9. Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all the lowercase 'x' chars have been moved
# to the end of the string.
