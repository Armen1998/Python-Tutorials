"""LOOPS"""

# 1. Write a program to loop through a range from 0 to 100 and print the even numbers only.

# 2. Write a program to loop through a range from 350 to 677 and print only numbers ending with 7.

# 3. Print every 6th number from 0 to 100.

# 4. Write a program that will output the multiplication table.

# 5. Write the FizzBuzz program. Only this time, loop through a range of 0-100 and for each iteration, print Fizz,
# if the loop variable is divisible by 3, Buzz, if it's divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz if it's divisible by both.

# 6. Write a program that will loop through a range of 0-1000 and print out only prime numbers.

# 7. Write a program that will keep a random number from 1-10 (use random package). The user must guess that number.
# They can input as many times as they want. Terminate the program with a congratulation message when the user has
# guessed the number.
#
# To make this more interesting, you can add lives (attempt limit) for the user, and after each guess let them know if
# their guess was larger or smaller from the actual number.

# 8. Binary search game
