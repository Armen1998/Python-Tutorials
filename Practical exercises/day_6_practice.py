"""FUNCTIONS"""

# 1. Write your version of max()/min() function (without using them inside your function). It will take a list as an
# argument and return max()/min() value of the list. You may write one function with a keyword argument, that will let
# the user switch between max()/min() or write two separate functions for each.

# 2. Write a function that will take a string as an argument. The function shall return number of upper-case and
# lower-case characters as a tuple.

# 3. Write the Fibonacci exercise in a function this time. The function accepts 1 numerical argument - n, and returns
# the n-th element from Fibonacci's sequence.

# 4. Write a function which will take a string as an argument, return True if the string is a palindrome and False
# otherwise.

# 5. Write a function which will take a list as an argument. If the list is monotonically descending, print that the
# list is 'descending'. Print increasing if it's monotonically 'increasing'. If it isn't monotonic, print 'neither'.

# 6. Write a function that will calculate the factorial of n.

# 7. Write a function that will take 4 arguments. First two are tuples and represent 2D coordinates of two circles.
# The others are the radii of our circles. The function must tell us whether one of the circles is inside the other, or
# do circles intersect, or are they far apart.

# 8. Write a function that sorts a list in ascending. Additionally, the function may take a keyword argument that will
# reverse the sort.

# 9. Create 3 numerical lists. Using the map function, return a new list, which is the element-wise sum of the 3 lists.
