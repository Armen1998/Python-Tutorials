# 1. Create Animal class with two methods - make_noise() and walk(). The methods shall print what the animal is doing.

# 2. Create a Triangle class, which will take side lengths as arguments and have methods to calculate perimeter and
# the area of the triangle. There must be a check whether a triangle with the given lengths can exist.

# 3. Let's write a Music Player Class!
#    a) Create a Song class. The class will have 4 attributes - name, artist, album and the year.
#    b) Now let's create a Playlist. Playlist class will contain Songs. We should have a method that will load songs
#    into our playlist. A file called albums.txt is provided with this exercise. The method should take care of loading
#    the songs from the file and store them inside of our Playlist class.
#    c) Finally, we need our Player itself. Create a Player class. The player may contain at least one playlist. A few
#    of its methods include play(), that will start playing from the beginning, show_now_playing, that will show the
#    information of the song that is playing now, next_song, that will start playing the next song, prev_song, that does
#    the opposite and finally a stop() method, that stops the song that is playing.
#
#    Note: The aforementioned points are necessary but it's not a complete description of a music player. Be creative
#    and add more functionality wherever you'll find it useful!
