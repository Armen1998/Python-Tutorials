# 1. Write a program that will ask to input a temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit units.
# Convert to C if the input is in F units and otherwise if it's in C units.
# Sample input -> 36C
# Output will be -> 96.8F

# 2. Given and integer, write a program which will output Fizz, if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz, if it's divisible
# by 5, and FizzBuzz if it's divisible by both.

# 3. Write a program that will take an input string from the user. If the string starts with "a" or "o", output it as it
# is, otherwise output the reverse of the string.

# 4. Write a program that will take an example password as an input. If the password contains less than 6 and more than
# 12 characters and it contains both numerical and alphabetical characters and a symbol from !, $, %, print that the
# password is good. Otherwise, prompt the user to change the password next time.
